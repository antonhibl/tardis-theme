* The Tardis Theme

I made this theme pretty much just for personal use but figured I would post it
to github for others as I know it was frustrating that I couldn't find another
theme like it. It was inspired by the [[https:quantum.country][quantum.country]] website which uses an
off-white background combined with shades of purple and shades of grey and black
fonts to achieve a nice clean look. I named this after the Tardis because I like
Dr. Who and was watching it when I made this theme. Please give credit if you
choose to share this theme, thank you and enjoy!

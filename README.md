# The Tardis Theme for Emacs
**Author:** *Anton Hibl*

I made this theme pretty much just for personal use but figured I would post it
to github for others as I know it was frustrating that I couldn't find another
theme like it. It was inspired by the https://quantum.country website which uses an
off-white background combined with shades of purple and shades of grey and black
fonts to achieve a nice clean look. I named this after the Tardis because I like
Dr. Who and was watching it when I made this theme. Please give credit if you
choose to share this theme, thank you and enjoy!

# Installation

[//]: # If you use MELPA, just do:

[//]: # M-x package-install [RET] tardis-theme [RET]

While this is waiting to merge into MELPA, put tardis-theme.el in either the
custom-theme-directory or load-path.

You can then apply the theme via M-x customize-themes, or make it the default by adding the following to your Emacs configuration:

   (load-theme 'tardis t)
